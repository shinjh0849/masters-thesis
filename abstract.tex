\abstractEN{
    Defect prediction studies have been actively conducted over the past decades.
    The existing defect prediction models face challenges in cold-start problem and the lack of actionable messages.
    To overcome these issues, various approaches such as Cross-Project Defect Prediction (CPDP), unsupervised defect prediction, and Just-in-time Defect Prediction (JIT-DP) have been studied.
    However, these studies still have limitations in several aspects.
    Hence, we propose a novel and potential approach of predicting defects in the commit level by searching for similar commits in existing software repositories.
    The model predicts a commit as ``buggy'' if the commit is similar to the existing Bug Inducing Commit (BIC) and if it is far away, it will predict as ``clean''.
    Then, it suggests a corresponding fix changes to the similar BIC as an actionable message for the bug-prone change.
    Our approach shows the potential to address the two issues of defect prediction models by alleviating the cold-start problems and suggesting patches for actionable messages.
