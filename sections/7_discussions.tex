In this chapter, we will discuss how this approach is important in software engineering practice, especially in automated quality assurance techniques and future work.

\section{Importance of this Approach}
Our defect-prediction approach is novel in that we built a large AED model of 196 projects to encode various change data and use the distance values achieved from the kNN model to make the prediction.
Our {\simfinmo} is fully universal which can be fully utilized in a CPDP setting without the need for historical metrics.
With this approach, we can say that the cold-start problem is fully alleviated.
Another major problem of defect prediction is the lack of actionable messages.
Traditional defect-prediction models predict the risk of a module in a file or at a method level.
For larger projects, developers need a significant amount of time to find the bug inside the risky module and fix it.
JIT-DP was actively studied to resolve the issue because code changes were typically significantly smaller than an entire file or method.
By reducing the granularity, developers can easily identify the location of the defect as the code to be inspected is shorter.
However, it does not resolve the fundamental problem.
JIT-DP does not inform the developers how the defect can be corrected.
Using {\simfinmo}, we can identify a risky change and also show the original BFC that is associated with the BIC with the nearest distance value.
The suggested BFC can act as an actionable message and provide insights to assist developers in fixing the risky change.
Fig. \ref{fig:ps_1} shows an example of a BFC that we collected from project tez, one of the testing projects.
Fig. \ref{fig:ps_2} shows an example of a suggested BFC generated by running SimFinMo on the BIC that is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:ps_1}.
Fig. \ref{fig:ps_2} shows that one parameter for calling a super constructor is added for a change.
By looking at Fig. \ref{fig:ps_1}, we can see that first and the third change is very similar to the suggested patch in that they are both adding a parameter in a method invocation.
Fig. \ref{fig:ps_2} added an AppContext instance as a parameter as its method creates a common container launcher context while Fig. 3 added an EventType info parameter as it is related to a handler method.
Based on the context of a change, developers can get an actionable message such as adding a missing parameter.
As the example illustrates, we hope that these suggested patches will help developers to act upon for quality assurance activity.
Our method of defect prediction is a novel technique that does not use a machine learning algorithm in the prediction phase.
In existing studies such as traditional, cross-project, heterogeneous, and just-in-time defect prediction, major issues are caused by the shortcomings of machine learning techniques.
Cold-start problem is caused because training data is necessary for the model to be built from the target project.
This issue is alleviated through the study of CPDP, however, CPDP does not perfectly solve the cold-start problem because many of the approaches use historical metrics as a feature. 
Because {\simfinmo} exploits existing software projects without the need for historical metrics, it fully resolves the cold-start problem.


\section{Future Work}
It is necessary to find the right threshold value to separate clean instances from buggy instances in the future.
We used different threshold values for different test projects with which we could only linearly separate the relationship among the classes.
However, more studies should be conducted to distinguish the relationship using a more complex and non-linear approach.
It was difficult to determine a global threshold that was suitable for all the projects.

Additionally, the suggested BFCs can be used as a code ingredient or mutation operator in automatic program repair (APR).
In APR, reducing the search space is critical to find the right patch within a feasible time. Ingredients or a list of operators retrieved from the suggested BFC can help reduce the search space to find the correct patch.
So these patch suggestions not only have a high potential for actionable defect prediction but also for more efficient APR technique as well.
