We proposed a novel universal and actionable JIT-DP model that overcomes the main limitations of current defect prediction models, the lack of actionable messages, and the cold-start problem.
This study is the first of its kind in that it predicts defective modules at a change level without a machine-learning predictor. 
Although {\simfinmo} is not perfect, it does surpass some of the most used machine-learning algorithms.
Further studies in this direction will contribute to automated quality assurance techniques such as defect prediction and APR.
Studies on topics such as finding a better solution to determine a global cut-off value or collecting a higher quality of defects and clean changes will hopefully enhance the prediction performance and contribute to the provision of better actionable messages.
