\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, we have proposed a novel approach for a universal actionable defect prediction model that resolves the biggest limitation of current defect prediction model such as cold-start problem and lack of actionable messages.
This study is the first of a kind that tackles to predict defective modules in change level without a machine learning predictor. 
Although the suggested {\simfinmo}, has relatively low prediction performance we believe more studies of this direction will contribute to automated quality assurance techniques, such as defect prediction and automatic program repair.
More related studies such as finding a better solution for setting the cut-off value and a way of collecting higher quality of defect and useful clean changes will enhance the prediction performance to contribute in better actionable messages.
